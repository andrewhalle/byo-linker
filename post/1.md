## Parsing ELF Files

The first step of writing our linker will be parsing ELF files. We'll use `nom`
to easily parse ELF files into in-memory data structures, and along the way
we'll learn about what all goes into an ELF file. I'll closely mirror the
[System V ABI documentation](http://www.sco.com/developers/gabi/latest/contents.html)
in my sections.

### What is an ELF file?

An ELF file (stands for <u>E</u>xecutable and <u>L</u>inkable <u>F</u>ormat) is
a standard format for object files, shared libraries, and executables. In the
compilation pipeline, an ELF file is the output of the assembler, and both the
input and output of the linker. ELF files serve a few distinct purposes

 * contain the machine code that will form the running program
 * contain information for linking separately compiled object files together
 * contain information for building the process image

There are 3 main types of ELF file:

 1. *Relocatable files:* relocatable ELF files contain object code that is
    ready to be linked with other object files, static libraries (which are
    just archives of object files), and shared libraries. Relocatable files are
    not independently usable, as they need to be _relocated_ (we'll get to
    exactly what that means in a little bit).
 2. *Executable files:* executable ELF files contain executable code with no
    unresolved references. The bytes in an executable ELF file are directly
    loaded into memory by the operating system and executed.
 3. *Shared object files:* shared object ELF files contain position independent
    code that are loaded directly into memory at runtime. Executable ELF files
    which link with shared objects declare their dependency on the shared
    object file in their metadata, and rely on the dynamic linker (part of the
    operating system) to load the associated shared objects into memory at
    runtime.

### Setting up

We'll start by setting up a new Rust project.

```bash
cargo new linker
```

and filling `main.rs`.

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Read;
use std::path::PathBuf;
use structopt::StructOpt;

use ld_rs::elf::ElfFile64;
use ld_rs::link;

#[derive(StructOpt, Debug)]
#[structopt(name = "basic")]
struct Opt {
    #[structopt(name = "FILE", parse(from_os_str))]
    filenames: Vec<PathBuf>,
}

fn generic_error(action: &str) -> ! {
    eprintln!("Something went wrong {} that file.", action);
    std::process::exit(1)
}

fn main() {
    let opt = Opt::from_args();

    let mut elfs = Vec::new();

    for f in opt.filenames.iter() {
        let mut buf = Vec::new();
        let mut file = File::open(f).unwrap_or_else(|_| generic_error("opening"));
        file.read_to_end(&mut buf)
            .unwrap_or_else(|_| generic_error("reading"));

        match ElfFile64::parse(&buf[..]) {
            Ok(elf) => {
                elfs.push(elf);
            }
            Err(_) => {
                eprintln!("That is not an ELF file!");
                std::process::exit(1);
            }
        };
    }

    let mut file = File::create("output.o").expect("could not create file");
    ElfFile64::write_out(link(elfs), &mut file).expect("could not write file");
}
```

First, I've used `structopt` to easily parse command-line options. The
arguments to the linker are a list of relocatable object files which we'll link
together into a new relocatable object file (our linker will do the equivalent
of `ld -r` it will produce an object file which still needs to be relocated).

In `main`, we first parse the command line arguments. Next, for each file
specified on the command line, we open it and parse an ELF file with
`ElfFile64::parse` (which we'll define shortly). Once we have our list of ELF
files, we link them together with `link` (see post [#3](XXX) of this series)
and write the result out to a new object file `output.o` (see post [#2](XXX) of
this series).

### ElfFile64

The `ElfFile64` type represents a 64-bit ELF file (there are also 32-bit ELF
files which our linker will not support). There are two representations of an
ELF file: there is the representation of the file on disk, and there is the
in-memory representation we will use to link (`ElfFile64`). To parse, we will
write parser combinators for several `ElfFile64*Raw` types which we will
combine into an `ElfFile64`.

We define the `ElfFile64` type in an `elf` module.

```rust
mod parse;
pub mod relocation;
pub mod section;
pub mod symbol;
mod write;

use parse::{ElfFile64HeaderRaw, ElfFile64Raw, ElfFile64RawParseError};
use relocation::get_relocations;
use section::{get_sections, organize_sections, Section64};
use symbol::{get_symbols, Symbol64};

pub const ELF_MAGIC: &[u8] = b"\x7FELF";
pub const EHSIZE_64: usize = 64;

#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct ElfFile64 {
    pub header: ElfFile64HeaderRaw,
    pub unorganized_sections: Vec<Section64>,
    pub symbols: Vec<Symbol64>,
}

#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum ElfFileError {
    ParseError,
    InvalidFileError,
}

impl From<ElfFile64RawParseError> for ElfFileError {
    fn from(_: ElfFile64RawParseError) -> Self {
        ElfFileError::ParseError
    }
}

impl ElfFile64 {
    pub fn parse(input: &[u8]) -> Result<ElfFile64, ElfFileError> {
        Ok(ElfFile64Raw::parse(input)?.into())
    }
}

impl From<ElfFile64Raw> for ElfFile64 {
    fn from(raw: ElfFile64Raw) -> Self {
        let sections = get_sections(&raw);

        let (mut unorganized_sections, symtab, relas, index_map) = organize_sections(sections);

        let symbols = get_symbols(&raw, &symtab, &index_map);
        for rela in relas {
            let referenced_section = &mut unorganized_sections[rela.info as usize];
            referenced_section.relocations = Some(get_relocations(&raw, &rela));
        }

        ElfFile64 {
            header: raw.header,
            unorganized_sections,
            symbols,
        }
    }
}
```

In this section, we first define some modules that we'll use later. Then, we
define the `ElfFile64` type itself, which is primarily a list of sections and
symbols (we also keep the header around which we'll parse in the next section,
mainly to make writing the ELF out easier). We also define a custom error enum
(which isn't really required for a project like this, but is good practice in
larger libraries). `ElfFile64::parse` is implemented by calling
`ElfFile64Raw::parse` on the bytes of the file, and calling `.into()` on the
result. Finally, we implement `From<ElfFile64Raw>` for `ElfFile64`. We carry
forward the raw header, separate the sections which we'll turn into separate
in-memory data structures (the symbol table and relocations table), and return
the `ElfFile64` at the end. We'll get more into what each of the helper
functions does in a moment.
